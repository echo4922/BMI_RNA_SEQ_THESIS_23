# BMI_RNA_SEQ_23
RNA-SEQ Analysis Graduate Thesis

To keep track record of what I am doing for Master's Thesis as Bioinformatics student, I have decided to create a github repository.
I'm not an expert by all means. I am a student after all trying to figure things out. Three specific purposes for this github repository:
#1. To hold myself accountable and save changes/logs <br />
#2. To explain what codes do and why it matters. In Bioinformatics world, there are lots of terms/jargons. Thus, it may be daunting to understand all the terms <br />
#3. To familiarize myself using Github website. In 21st cenutry, it is absolute essential to know how to use the website and its feature for those who work in data field <br />
