How to analyze RNA sequencing Data <br />
Student's guide to analyze Biological Data, specifcally RNA-sequencing data  for students by a student (me) <br />

To keep track record of what I am doing for Master's Thesis as Bioinformatics student, I have decided to create a github page.
I'm not an expert by all means. After all, I am just a student trying to figure things out. Three specific purposes for this github repository: <br />

#1. To hold myself accountable and save changes/logs <br />

#2. To explain what codes do and why it matters. In Bioinformatics world, there are lots of terms/jargons. Thus, it may be daunting to understand all the terms <br />

#3. To familiarize myself using Github website. In 21st cenutry, it is absolute essential to know how to use the website and its feature for those who work in data field <br />

**Why analyzing biological data difficult?**

As I was taking numerous classes in a graduate school as Bioinformatics student, I noticed something about biological data. In world of Biology, data format often does not end with .csv nor .xlsx. This means that a user cannot simply peak at the data by using proprietary software like Microsoft Excel or its alternative like Google Spreadsheets then start analyzing right away with Python or any other programming language.  Because data format does not simply end with .csv nor .xlsx, this works as both advantage and disadvantage to end users (researchers). That means it is open source by nature becomes users do not need to use proprietary software. However, It needs careful data preprocessing just for data analysis, which makes users often feel overwhelming. <br />

I thought a lot about this. While there are some biological data ends with .csv or .xlsx, most of biological data do not have .csv or .xlsx format. Why? My observation about biology world: <br />

I do believe that part of it has to do with decentralized nature of data format in Biology. Most of biological data has been emerged and generated from academia or public sector. Private sector then picked up on research from academia then expanded to offer products and services to meet individual needs back to public sector and/or another private sector. Thus, the decentralized data format where no one company dominates the data analysis software nor format means lots of intellectual freedom to explore on usersâ€™ (researchers) end. On the other hand, because in bioinformatics, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, it is up to users to find most suitable solutions. It should be noted that, however, even in biology world, there is specific data format to follow. For instance, sequencing data results end with .fastq based on fasta, which is based on text to represent nucleotide sequence or amino acid (protein) sequence.<br />
